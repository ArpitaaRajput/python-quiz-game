# python-quiz-game
"This project is a simple command-line Quiz Game built in Python. It asks multiple-choice questions, lets the user enter their answers, and provides instant feedback (correct or wrong). At the end of the quiz, it shows the correct answers, the userâ€™s guesses, and their final score. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates Python basics such as loops, conditionals, tuples, and user input, while also being fun to play and easy to expand with more questions."
